        </header>
        <p>You are about to help out at an OpenTechSchool workshop as a coach. With this presentation we want to give you a quick introduction of what that means.</p>
        <p>The focus for the event is to show learners that coding and tech is nothing to be afraid of but is a lot of fun.</p>

          <h2>Introduction to Coaching</h2>
        </header>
        <p>This OTS coaching style has its root in the <a href="http://curriculum.railsbridge.org/workshop/teacher_training">RailsBridge teaching style</a>. As such it is very focussed on creating a friendly and open environment for learners of all sorts.</p>
        <p>How to achieve this and have a pleasant learning experience is focus of this presentation.</p>

          <h2>The Material</h2>
        </header>
        <p>We strongly believe the best way to learn to code — or any other tech related topic for that matter — is by hands-on, experience oriented and pragmatic workshop worked through on ones own pace. Our curricula are designed for exactly that purpose.</p>
        <p>That is also reflected in the way we organise ourself on sight: there is no class-room-style setting, everyone has their own workspace instead. There is no teacher in front and there is no one going through the material with a presenter.</p>

          <h2>Coaching ain't Teaching</h2>
        </header>
        <p>In that regard we are not standing in front and teach here. Coaches</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stand by on the sideline.</li>
            <li>Are right there when needed.</li>
            <li>Focus on the learners.</li>
            <li>Have sympathy for their (in-)abilities.</li>
            <li>Encourage to go further through motivation.</li>
            <li>And ensure one has fun doing it.</li>

            <li>Make eye contact.</li>
            <li>Admit your ignorance.</li>
            <li>Be kind and friendly.</li>
            <li>Use their name (we all have name tags).</li>

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Assume that anyone you're teaching to has zero knowledge but infinite intelligence.</li>
            <li>Encourage learners to ask questions.</li>
            <li>Respond positively.</li>
            <li>Use normal language over jargon.</li>
            <li>Look around whether someone else might be having troubles.</li>
            <li>Make sure whether the learner understood what you said.</li>
            <li>And explain it again — differently — if not the case yet.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Get people comfortable asking questions.</li>
            <li>Ask for questions — even dumb ones.</li>
            <li>Give other learners the possibility to try to answer that question.</li>
            <li>Coding is collaboration — make sure the learners understand that.</li>

          <h2>Responding to questions</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Chances are, there is a certain question when the learner calls you to help them. How do you respond?</p>
        <strong>Positively</strong>: 
        <ul>
          <li><em>I’m glad you said that.</em></li>
          <li><em>What an interesting question.</em></li>
          <li><em>Great question.</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If in doubt: blame the material, never the learner!</p>

            <li>Talk sssssslllllloooooowwwwwwllllllyyyyyyyy.</li>

          <h2>We do not discuss programming languages</h2>
        </header>
        <p>It is just confusing to learners: In the tech community we are having some strong opinions and our ways to express those. But for people new to it this can quickly look like a huge fight. And we do not fight each other.</p>
        <p>We are here to coach you in this programming language/method/technology and that is the focus for this event.</p>
